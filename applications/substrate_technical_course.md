## Project Description :page_facing_up:

I am a software enginner which within company where I look for business outcomes which potentially can Substrate delivers. I know that the best way to learn is to build and after listining to presentation given by Tomasz DrwiÄ™ga (Core Dev in Polkadot) in Warsow and then some talk with Him I decided to dive deeper into Substrate. I have already signed an agreement to deliver a VOD course regarding "blockchain technology" for one of the biggest publishing house in Poland, the publisher is focused on programming and generally IT market.

After diving into Substrate (and currently Hackusama) I concluded that I want to show in my course more deeply Substrate architecture and Kusama network.

### Milestone

The output of the grant will be around 45 minutes time window (in the form of video) in the course regarding blockchain technology on one of the biggest VOD platform for developers in Poland. The scope of the course is up to me, for sure I want to show:

1. architecture of Substrate

2. ecosystem of Polkadot

3. explain and show pallets

4. explain where is added value of Kusama (security, consensus, runtime upgrades)

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

I have written an article regarding Substrate: https://waszczyk.com/introduction-to-polkadot's-ecosystem-and-hackusama and I just think that Substrate is a good candidate for explaining the blockchain technology for developers and I am involved in ambassador program.
