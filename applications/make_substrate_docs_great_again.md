## Project Description :page_facing_up:

I am software enginner which within company where I look for business outcomes which potentially can Substrate delivers. I know that the best way to learn is to build and after listining to presentation given by Tomasz DrwiÄ™ga (Core Dev in Polkadot) in Warsow and then some talk with Him I decided to dive deeper into Substrate.  

When I got some free time I decided to dive into technicals and start from the documentation and during presentation for management board of Substrate I discovered that many, many links in documentation just does not work. Some scanner which looks for 404's links shown me around ~500 bad links on the following page https://www.substrate.io/. At the begining of reading the documentation I was thinking that I just found one bad link and decided to contribute by making the pull request https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/knowledgebase/pull/78 but then I found many of them and decided to apply of the grant just to improve the documentation of the software.

Where is see the value in the grant? I just want to make the documentation more readable for builders and new comming software engineers just like me.

Below a part of report from the scanner of not working links:

The output of the grant will be many PRs to Substrate's official documentation like that that one https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/knowledgebase/pull/78 to clean and improve links and details.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

The main goal of the grant is to answer the question whether Substrate can help us to deliver the value for our clients. Currently I am an one guy team in the company which knows and is interested in Substrate and I need to get to know about Substrate as much as possible. When I saw that the docs does not work properly (I guess that there was some migration of the documentation) I decided to apply. Also few days ago I organining the meetup with Plasm Network (https://www.meetup.com/Silesia-Blockchain-Meetup/events/270449669/) and the presentation was promising.
